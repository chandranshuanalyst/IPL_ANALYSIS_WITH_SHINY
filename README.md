This is continuation of IPL Analysis project and in this we have deployed the R code in web using R Shiny.

### Important Points to remember :
* The data files should be in the project diretory in a data folder.
* The address for the files in read.csv should be shortened one as Data/file_name.csv .
* The libraries and their dependencies should be prespecified .
* We used bslib to apply themes in R shiny.
